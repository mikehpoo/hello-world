# hello-world
My first foray in Java programming with a self set goal. 

To create a win-line based slot machine with:
	- A range of symbols and payouts,
	- An interactive UI,
	- Implementation of sounds.
	
The learning outcomes were familiarisation with Java Swing, Workers, and the use of Git itself.
