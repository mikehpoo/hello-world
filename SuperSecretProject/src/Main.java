/**
 * 
 * This machine will simulate a slot machine, for simplicity sake I will refer to a wheel as having 5 points
 * The wheel will represented by an array of string, this is to make printing out the array as I go easier; I'll probably swap to char later on
 * Each point is a String representing a value, A for Ace, K for King, Q for Queen, J to Jack, and finally T for Ten.
 * so a wheel could look like (A,K,T,T,K) for example
 * 
 * RandomiseWheels will generate random points and place them on a wheel
 * 
 * TBA: class will look at generated wheels and check for win lines
 * TBA: class will on win lines being generated announce a payout
 * TBA: class will keep track of wins, spins and total losses/earnings
